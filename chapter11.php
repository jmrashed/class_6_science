                            To displace an object from one position to another we need to apply something on it. This something is force. Again, this force is of different types. Moreover, there are various techniques of applying force. By applying this technique work can be made much easier. Whatever is used to make this force work easily is known as simple machine.

                            "Milly opened the fridge and brought out chilled can of soda. She slammed it, opened the soda and gulped it down.

                        She was upset it was finished too soon and so she crushed the can in her hand and threw the empty can into the bin. " Milly applied force in many of her actions. Her actions involved the use of force to lift, open, turn, move and even change the shape of something. Force, together with its various types are applied in almost every single activity in our lives. Pushing the shopping cart, pulling the baby stroller, lifting weights at the gym, eating and many other things involve the use of some force.

                        <p style="color:#13007C; font-weight: bold;margin-top: 20px">Affect of different types of forces on an object </p>
                        <p>Let us now find out what happens when a force acts on an object. You might recall similar situations. For example, while taking a penalty kick in football, 
                            the player applies a force on the ball. Before being hit, the ball was at rest and so its speed  was zero. The applied force makes the ball move towards the goal. Suppose, the goalkeeper  dives or jumps up to save the goal. By his action the goalkeeper tries to apply a force on the moving ball. The force applied by him can stop or deflect the ball, saving a goal being scored. If the goalkeeper succeeds in stopping the ball, its speed decreases to zero.
                        </p>

                        These observations suggest that a force applied on an object may change its speed. If the force applied on the object is in the direction of its motion, the speed of the object increases. If the force is applied in the direction opposite to the direction of motion, then it results in a decrease in the speed of the object. Let us consider some more examples. In a game of volleyball, players often push the moving ball to their teammates to make a winning move. Sometimes the ball is returned to the other side of the court by pushing or smashing it. In cricket, a batsman plays his or her shot by applying a force on the ball with the bat. Is there any change in the direction of motion of the ball in these cases? In all these examples the speed and the direction of the moving ball change due to the application of a force. Can you give a few more examples of this kind?
                        <br> A change in either the speed of an object, or its direction of motion, or both, is described as a change in its state of motion. Thus, a force may bring a change in the state of motion of an object.

                        <p>The state of motion of an object is described by its speed and the direction of motion. The state of rest is considered to be the state of zero speed. An object may be at rest or in motion; both are its states of motion. It is common experience that many a time application of force does not result in a change in the state of motion.                        </p>
                        <P>For example, a heavy box may not move at all even if you apply the maximum force that you can exert. Again, no effect of force is observed when you try to push a wall.</P>

                            A force can be a push or a pull. It is not something you can see or touch, but can see it in action. Forces can be measured using a device called force meter. The unit of force is called the newton. It is represented by the symbol N. A force of 2N is smaller that 7N.

                <p style="text-justify">Throughout history, humans have developed a number of devices to make work easier. The most notable of these are known as the "six simple machines": the wheel and axle, the lever, the inclined plane, the pulley, the screw and the wedge, although the latter three are actually  just extensions or combinations of the first three.
                    Because work is defined as force acting on an object in the direction of motion, a machine makes work easier to perform by accomplishing one or more of the following functions:</p>
                <div class="paddingLeft30px">•	transferring a force from one place to another,</div>
                <div class="paddingLeft30px">•	changing the direction of a force, </div>

                <div class="paddingLeft30px">•	increasing the distance or speed of a force. </div> 
                <p align="justify"> Many machines combine more than one of these devices to make work easier. For instance, we might attach a long handle to a shaft to make a windlass, or use a block and tackle to pull a load up a ramp. While these machines may seem simple, they continue to provide us with the means to do many things that we could never do without them.

Many plants and animals have evolved natural machines like arm muscles (a kind of lever) or teeth (a kind of wedge) or a bacteria's flagellum (a kind of screw). Many animals also make machines out of dirt, wood, and stone. People make machines too. There are six different kinds of simple machines. Many of the more complicated machines we use are made of combinations of these six simple ideas.

                        A lever is a simple machine that allows you to gain a mechanical advantage in moving an object or in applying a force to an object. It is considered a "pure" simple machine because friction is usually so small that it is not considered a factor to overcome, as in other simple machines.

                        A lever consists of a rigid bar or beam that is allowed to rotate or pivot about a fulcrum. An applied force is then used to move a load. There are three common types or classes of levers, depending on where the fulcrum and applied force is located. The mechanical advantage is that you can move a heavy object using less force than the weight of the object, you can propel an object faster by applying a force at a slower speed, or you can move an object further than the distance you apply to the lever.

                <p style="text-align: justify;">There are three types or classes of levers, according to where the load and effort are located with respect to the  fulcrum.

                        A class 1 lever has the fulcrum placed between the effort and load. The movement of the load is in the opposite  direction of the movement of the effort. This is the most typical lever configuration. For example: Forceps,  balance etc.</p>

When nails are plucked by hammer force is applied by holding the hammer’s handle by the hand.  Again a nail is plucked by pressing the hammer against the area surrounding the nail, which functions as  fulcrum. In this ease the resistance against pulling out of the nail functions as weight.

                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <p align="justify">An inclined plane works by reducing the amount of force needed to lift an object from a lower point to a higher one. The inclined plane is normally a flat surface that extends from the lowest point up to the highest, which allows things to be moved up and down the incline easier than lifting it straight up or down. The amount of force needed to move an object up an inclined plane is determined by the length of the plane between the two points. The longer the plane, the less force is needed to move, but it will take longer to get from point A to point B. A shorter plane will require more force, but less time from point to point.</p>

If the slope is steep, a person has to push or pull the object over a very short distance, but with more effort. For example; there is a greater mechanical advantage if the slope is gentle because less force will be needed to move an object up or down the slope. Some good examples of inclined planes are accessibility ramps and roofs of houses.

                    <p align="justify" >The pulley is actually a version of a wheel and axle that is combined with a rope, chain or other cord to allow moving something up and down or back and forth. The pulley can be combined with other pulleys to reduce the amount of work necessary to lift huge amounts of weight or to lower them down. It can also make moving something such as a flag up the pole convenient to do from the ground. It changes the direction of the force necessary to do the work. I pull down on the rope, but the flag goes up.Pulleys are used in window blinds and drapery to move them up and down or back and forth. Pulleys are also used on ships to raise and lower sails, in industry to raise and lower heavy cargo, or on cranes for use in moving construction equipment. Elevators also use pulleys to move the car up and down from floor to floor.

                    <p> Static pulley is one in which the block remains at rest and only the disc rotates. Hoisting flag is an example of static pulley. The pulley rotates as soon as the rope is pulled. The flag will be hoisted as high as much the rope is pulled down. As a result, mechanical efficiency is not available but the direction of force is changed.</p>



                    <h4 style="color:blue">2) Dynamic pulley:</h4>
                    <p>Dynamic pulley is one which is not at rest and it rotates with the rotation of the pulley. It has mechanical efficiency available in it and in this case the rope is to be pulled twice the distance of the height in which the body is to be lifted. To get this efficiency the static and dynamic pulley is used in combination. The technique can be used to change the direction of force to avail the efficiency. </p>

                <div class="col-md-12" style="text-align: justify;">
                    Wheel-rod axis is one type of simple machine. A wheel and axle consists of two circular pieces of different sizes attached to each other. The larger circular piece is the wheel in the system, and the smaller circular piece is the axle. One of the circular pieces can be considered as the effort arm of the lever and the second, the resistance arm. The place at which the two are joined is the fulcrum of the system.Some examples of the wheel and axle include a door knob, a screwdriver, an egg beater, a water wheel, the steering wheel of an automobile, and the crank used to raise a bucket of water from a well. When the wheel in a wheel and axle machine is turned, so is the axle, and vice versa. For example, when you turn the handle of a screwdriver, the edge that fits into the screw head turns at the same time.The mechanical advantage of a wheel and axle machine can be found by dividing the radius of the wheel by the radius of the axle. For example, suppose that the crank on a water well turns through a radius of 2 ft (61 cm) and the radius of the axle around which the rope is wrapped is 4 in (10 cm). Then the mechanical advantage of this wheel and axle system is 2 ft divided by 4 in, or 6.
