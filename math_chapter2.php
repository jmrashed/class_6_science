                        <p>  We use ratios to make comparisons between two things. When we express ratios in words, we use the word “to” - we say “the ratio of something to something else”. Ratios can be written in several different ways; like fraction, using the word “to”, or with a colon. Suppose we want to write the ratio of 3 and 4. We can write this as 3:4 or as a fraction    , and we say the ratio is three to four.</p>
                        <p>
                            Let's use the illustration of shapes given below to learn more about ratios. How can we write the ratio of this number squares to the number of circles? The most common way to write a ratio is as a fraction,     . We could also write it using the word “to”, as “3 to 6”. Finally, we could write this ratio using a colon between the two numbers, 3:6. Be sure you understand that these are all ways to write the same number.

For example, if we divide both terms in the ratio 3 : 6 by the number 3, then we get the equal ratio, 1 : 2. Do you see that these ratios both represent the same comparison?

            Equivalent Ratios
            As mentioned earlier, the ratio 3 : 6 and the ratio 1 : 2 are equivalent. 
            To find out if two ratios are equal, we divide both the antecedent and the 
            subsequent by their H.C.F and then check for equality.
            Some examples of equivalent ratios are:
            3 : 6 = 12 : 24 = 6 : 12 = 15 : 30
             You can also use decimals and percentages to compare two quantities. 
             In our previous example of squares to circles, the ratio of square to circle is 3:6 or simply 1:2.

            Example 2.1.1
            Are 3 : 12 and 18 : 72 equal ratios?

            Solution:
            H.C.F of 3 and 12 is 3
            So, 3 : 12 = (3 ÷ 3) : (12 ÷ 3) = 1 : 4
            H.C.F. of 18 and 72 is 18
            So, 18 : 72 = (18 ÷ 18) : (72 ÷ 18) = 1 : 4
            ⸫ 3 : 12 = 18 : 72
            ⸫ They are equal ratio.

                <p style="text-justify">Throughout history, humans have developed a number of devices to make work easier. The most notable of these are known as the "six simple machines": the wheel and axle, the lever, the inclined plane, the pulley, the screw and the wedge, although the latter three are actually  just extensions or combinations of the first three.
                    Because work is defined as force acting on an object in the direction of motion, a machine makes work easier to perform by accomplishing one or more of the following functions:</p>
                <div class="paddingLeft30px">•	transferring a force from one place to another,</div>
                <div class="paddingLeft30px">•	changing the direction of a force, </div>

                <p align="justify"> Many machines combine more than one of these devices to make work easier. For instance, we might attach a long handle to a shaft to make a windlass, or use a block and tackle to pull a load up a ramp. While these machines may seem simple, they continue to provide us with the means to do many things that we could never do without them.

Many plants and animals have evolved natural machines like arm muscles (a kind of lever) or teeth (a kind of wedge) or a bacteria's flagellum (a kind of screw). Many animals also make machines out of dirt, wood, and stone. People make machines too. There are six different kinds of simple machines. Many of the more complicated machines we use are made of combinations of these six simple ideas.

                        A lever is a simple machine that allows you to gain a mechanical advantage in moving an object or in applying a force to an object. It is considered a "pure" simple machine because friction is usually so small that it is not considered a factor to overcome, as in other simple machines.

                        A lever consists of a rigid bar or beam that is allowed to rotate or pivot about a fulcrum. An applied force is then used to move a load. There are three common types or classes of levers, depending on where the fulcrum and applied force is located. The mechanical advantage is that you can move a heavy object using less force than the weight of the object, you can propel an object faster by applying a force at a slower speed, or you can move an object further than the distance you apply to the lever.

                        A class 3 lever has the effort between the load and the fulcrum. Both the effort and load are in the same direction. Because of the configuration, the fulcrum must prevent the lever beam from moving upward or downward. Often a bearing is used to allow the beam to pivot. For example: pincers.</p>

When nails are plucked by hammer force is applied by holding the hammer’s handle by the hand.  Again a nail is plucked by pressing the hammer against the area surrounding the nail, which functions as  fulcrum. In this ease the resistance against pulling out of the nail functions as weight.

                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <p align="justify">An inclined plane works by reducing the amount of force needed to lift an object from a lower point to a higher one. The inclined plane is normally a flat surface that extends from the lowest point up to the highest, which allows things to be moved up and down the incline easier than lifting it straight up or down. The amount of force needed to move an object up an inclined plane is determined by the length of the plane between the two points. The longer the plane, the less force is needed to move, but it will take longer to get from point A to point B. A shorter plane will require more force, but less time from point to point.</p>

If the slope is steep, a person has to push or pull the object over a very short distance, but with more effort. For example; there is a greater mechanical advantage if the slope is gentle because less force will be needed to move an object up or down the slope. Some good examples of inclined planes are accessibility ramps and roofs of houses.

Jack-screw follows the principle of lever and inclined plane at the same time. The height of the portion of the twisted screw is the height of the inclined plane and the distance travelled through the twisted path is the length of the inclined plane. By increasing the length of the inclined plane, we can get mechanical advantage. On the other hand, the direction in which the force is applied on the handle, the load acts in the opposite direction. So by increasing the forces as well as changing the direction of force, jack-screw makes work easier.

                    <p align="justify" >The pulley is actually a version of a wheel and axle that is combined with a rope, chain or other cord to allow moving something up and down or back and forth. The pulley can be combined with other pulleys to reduce the amount of work necessary to lift huge amounts of weight or to lower them down. It can also make moving something such as a flag up the pole convenient to do from the ground. It changes the direction of the force necessary to do the work. I pull down on the rope, but the flag goes up.Pulleys are used in window blinds and drapery to move them up and down or back and forth. Pulleys are also used on ships to raise and lower sails, in industry to raise and lower heavy cargo, or on cranes for use in moving construction equipment. Elevators also use pulleys to move the car up and down from floor to floor.

                    <p> Static pulley is one in which the block remains at rest and only the disc rotates. Hoisting flag is an example of static pulley. The pulley rotates as soon as the rope is pulled. The flag will be hoisted as high as much the rope is pulled down. As a result, mechanical efficiency is not available but the direction of force is changed.</p>



                    <h4 style="color:blue">2) Dynamic pulley:</h4>
                    <p>Dynamic pulley is one which is not at rest and it rotates with the rotation of the pulley. It has mechanical efficiency available in it and in this case the rope is to be pulled twice the distance of the height in which the body is to be lifted. To get this efficiency the static and dynamic pulley is used in combination. The technique can be used to change the direction of force to avail the efficiency. </p>

                <div class="col-md-12" style="text-align: justify;">
                    Wheel-rod axis is one type of simple machine. A wheel and axle consists of two circular pieces of different sizes attached to each other. The larger circular piece is the wheel in the system, and the smaller circular piece is the axle. One of the circular pieces can be considered as the effort arm of the lever and the second, the resistance arm. The place at which the two are joined is the fulcrum of the system.Some examples of the wheel and axle include a door knob, a screwdriver, an egg beater, a water wheel, the steering wheel of an automobile, and the crank used to raise a bucket of water from a well. When the wheel in a wheel and axle machine is turned, so is the axle, and vice versa. For example, when you turn the handle of a screwdriver, the edge that fits into the screw head turns at the same time.The mechanical advantage of a wheel and axle machine can be found by dividing the radius of the wheel by the radius of the axle. For example, suppose that the crank on a water well turns through a radius of 2 ft (61 cm) and the radius of the axle around which the rope is wrapped is 4 in (10 cm). Then the mechanical advantage of this wheel and axle system is 2 ft divided by 4 in, or 6.

                <div class="col-md-12" style="text-align: justify;">
                    <p>*  Force, together with its various types are applied in almost every single activity in our lives. Pushing the shopping cart, pulling the baby stroller, lifting weights at the gym, eating and many other things involve the use of some force.</p>
                    <p> *  When force is applied on a body:</p>
                    <p class="paddingLeft30px">•	may make an object move from rest.</p>
                    <p class="paddingLeft30px">•	may change the speed of an object if it is moving.</p>
                    <p class="paddingLeft30px">•	may change the direction of motion of an object.</p>
                    <p class="paddingLeft30px">•	may bring about a change in the shape of an object.</p>
                    <p class="paddingLeft30px">•	may cause some or all of these effects.</p>
                    <p>*  A lever is a simple machine that allows you to gain a mechanical advantage. It consists of a consists of a rigid  bar or beam that is allowed to rotate or pivot about a fulcrum, along with an applied force and load. The three types or classes of levers, depend on where the fulcrum and applied force is located.Uses for a lever are that you can move a heavy object using less force than the weight of the object, propel an object faster by applying a force at a slower speed, or move an object further than the distance you apply to the lever.                    </p> 
                    <p>*  The first class lever uses the fulcrum in between the applied force and load, the second class lever uses the load between the fulcrum and applied force and the third class lever uses the applied force between the fulcrum and the load. Levers help to lift heavy objects. Levers are one of the simplest machines. An example of a first class lever is a seesaw or balance beam, an example of a second class lever is a wheelbarrow and an example of a third class lever is the human forearm. In the human forearm, the elbow acts as the fulcrum, the applied force is the bicep muscle and the hand acts as the load.                    </p> 
                    <p>*  Some of the human organs follow the princple of lever                    </p> 
                    <p>*  Dynamic pulley is one which is not at rest and it rotates with the rotation of the pulley.                    </p> 
                    <p>*  Static pulley is one in which the block remains at rest and only the disc rotates.                    </p> 
                    <p>*  The pulley is actually a version of a wheel and axle that is combined with a rope, chain or other cord to allow  moving something up and down or back and forth. The pulley can be combined with other pulleys to reduce the amount of work necessary to lift huge amounts of weight or to lower them down.                    </p>

    <p>The ratio of black pens to blue pens that Mitu has is 4 : 1. Given that Mitu has 15 pens. Find how many blue
and black pens that she has? Also express the number of blue pens as a percentage of black pens.</p>
<div class="col-md-6">
Sume of the ratio = 4 + 1 = 5
4 out of 5 pens are black
So, of 15 pens are black
⸫ 12 pens are black
So, the number of blue pens = 15 – 12 = 3 pens
Alternatively, we could have used ratio here as well
So, the number of blue pens = of 15 = 3 pens
</div>
<div class="col-md-6">
2nd Part..
Percentage of blue pens to black pens
= × 100% = 25%
Alternatively, black pens to b lue pens ratio is given,
so the inverse ratio of 1 : 4 is the ratio of black pens
to blue pens.
⸫ Percentage = × 100% = 25%
