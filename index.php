                    Motion is one of the key topics in physics. Everything in the universe moves. It might only be a small amount of movement and very slow, but movement does happen. Don't forget that even if you appear to be  standing still, the Earth is moving around the Sun, and the Sun is moving around our galaxy. The movement  never stops. Motion is one part of what physicists call mechanics. Over the years, scientists have discovered  several rules or laws that explain motion and the causes of changes in motion. There are also special laws when you reach the speed of light or when physicists look at very small things like atoms.

An object is said to be at rest if it does not change its position with respect to its surroundings. Have you watched the night sky? We have observed that the position of stars and planets change while you  remain stationary. In reality the earth is moving too. Thus, an object which appears to be at rest, may actually be  in motion. Therefore, motion and rest are relative terms. To describe the motion of an object we have to specify how its position changes with respect to a stationary object. This is called the frame of reference.

                        <p align="justify">Motion is relative to an observer or to an object. For example, a woman driving a car is not in motion relative to the car, but she is in motion relative to an observer standing on the side of the road. A similar example is a cat  sleeping on a rug. The cat appears to be at rest to an observer on Earth, but relative to an object at a fixed point  in space, the cat is moving as fast as the Earth turns. As these examples show, discussions of motion must  include a point of reference, especially when calculating measurements such as speed. For example, if a train is traveling 90 miles per hour and a man walks from the back of a train car to the front, how fast is the man moving? The answer depends on the point of reference. To another passenger in the train, the man is moving at a rate much less than 90 miles per hour. To an observer outside of the train, however, the man is moving at a  rate slightly more than 90 miles per hour.</p>
                        <p align="justify">Most people consider motion relative to a fixed point on the Earth. Physicists consider that the universe has no 
                            fixed point, so all motion is relative to what is defined as a fixed point. In fact, this basic idea is part of  Einstein's theory of relativity.

                            The observer relative to whom motion or rest is determined is called reference frame. When you are standing on the ground, that is your frame of reference. Anything that you see, watch, or measure will be compared to the reference point of the ground. If I am standing in the back of a moving truck, the truck is now my frame of reference and everything will be measured compared to it. If you want to measure the distance of your school from your house, in this case your home is a reference frame.

                                    The universe is full of movements that repeat themselves over and over in patterns. The nice thing about  patterns is that we can describe and explain them, which often includes using math. For example, the term  periodic motion refers to any movement of an object that is repeated in a given length of time. Whatever the  motion may be, the period of time it takes to get back to where it started is called the time period of the motion. We can find dozens of examples of periodic motion in our everyday lives because so many actions and  movements are repetitive. A rocking chair rocking is periodic motion. A swing swinging is periodic motion. A  satellite orbiting the Earth is also periodic motion, as are the vibrations of a tuning fork or the swing of a pendulum.                           </p>

                        <p>
                            Fast Driving is commonly associated with the young and adventurous. But driving fast is extremely dangerous, and can cost you money for a ticket, at best, and your life, at worst.
                            Driving fast can be tempting. You can reach your destination in a shorter amount of time, and enjoy the breeze in your hair as you fly down the road. But before you start to hit the accelerator, there are a number of things you should think about.
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                            Speed is dangerous for a number of reasons. When vehicles travel at high speeds, the distance traveled in the same amount of time increases, decreasing the driverâ€™s ability to detect an emergency and react in time. The minimum distance needed to safely stop a vehicle is also decreased, leading to a higher likelihood of accidents. The consequences can be extremely expensive, painful, and even fatal. Our lives are more important than reaching a destination faster, or saving some time. Fast driving should never be encouraged.
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                            When driving fast, not only are you endangering your own life, you are also endangering the lives of others. Passengers, other drivers on the road, and pedestrians are all at an increased risk of accidents if you drive fast and carelessly.
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                            Beyond the risk of car crashes themselves, increasing your speed also increases your car expenditures. There are high chances you will, at the very least, be required to pay for your irresponsible decisions. The fines levied on speeding can be a major drain on your pocket, and can even lead to you having your license suspended or taken away entirely. For every speeding ticket you receive, points will also be added to your license, increasing the amount you pay for insurance. In fact, one four-point ticket has the capacity to increase your monthly car insurance premium by at least 50% over the next five years.
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                            At the end of the day, driving fast is just not worth it. So slow down on the road, save money, and commit to protecting your life and the lives of others.
